\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:sum}

Over the past decade convolutional neural networks have achieved results few expected would be possible in such a short time period, and recently they have been successfully implemented in the healthcare industry \cite{miotto2018deep}. Histopathological Cancer Detection program shows that deep learning algorithms can be applied in the field of histopathology, and achieve high performance results in order to reduce workload from doctors, and help speed up the process. More importantly, it overcomes one of the major drawbacks of deep learning algorithms, which is the notion of algorithms being 'black-boxes', i.e. not being highly interpretable. By implementing multiple techniques to further analyze network and its decisions, it is possible to explain and clarify network outputs and determine whether such reasoning is correct or not.

\section{Future Work}

After completing the thesis and creating a program for histopathologic cancer detection on breast and colorectal tissue, there are multiple ways of extending the scope of the program: adding more tissue types in order to increase solving power, adding additional ways to further analyze results, and improving graphical user interface in order to make it even more straightforward to use.

ACDC@LUNGHP\footnote{Automatic Cancer Detection and Classification in Whole-slide Lung Histopathology 2019} challenge provides the dataset for lung cancer histopathologic detection, which could be used for extending the program scope. DigestPath2019\footnote{Digestive-System Pathological Detection and Segmentation Challenge 2019} challenge provides the dataset for colorectal histopathologic cancer detection, which could be used to improve the accuracy of already existing CNNSimple network. Additional histopathology datasets are publicly available, such as the ECDP2020 grand challenge dataset and ANHIR\footnote{ Automatic Non-rigid Histological Image Registration} challenge dataset.

Another way to visually interpret and further analyze CNN classification results and increase the interpretability of the networks is by using deconvolutional neural networks (DCNNs) \cite{zeiler2011adaptive}.
